# Accountable Device

The device does not think of itself as a camera.

It wakes with no network, no name, and no witness,
only the clock crystal ticking inside its board.
When the operator unlocks it, that act is logged.
Not as permission, but as intent.
The machine never assumes it is allowed to see.
It is told.

When motion crosses the frame, the system does not
cry alarm.
It waits.
It watches the transition.
It measures confirmation windows the way a lie
detector measures breath.
Only when the pattern persists does it commit
memory to disk.
What it records is not video.
It is testimony.

Each clip is sealed, hashed, and wrapped.
It is placed in an outbox like evidence in a cold
locker.
The device never sends it itself.
It does not trust networks.
It waits for a courier.

Somewhere else, far away, another machine receives
the package.
It does not ask what happened.
It asks whether the story is intact.

Years later, when the event is questioned,
when lawyers argue and timelines fracture,
the machine does not defend itself.
It opens its ledger and states:
this is what was requested,
this is what was observed,
this is what was preserved.
Nothing more.
Nothing less.

In a future full of systems that hallucinate
confidence, this one survives by refusing to
guess.

It is not intelligent.

It is accountable.

In the quiet between power cycles, the recorder
waits.
Sealed disk closed.
Network denied.
Camera dark.

When the operator turns the key and speaks intent
into the system, it wakes like an instrument in a
lab.
Not curious.
Not helpful.
Not chatty.
Just precise.

The moment is captured.
It is stamped.
It is hashed.
It is sealed.
Then the system returns to silence.

In a world where everything leaks by default,
the rarest technology is not intelligence.

It is restraint.
