# Narrowband Intuition

Somewhere in the 2030s, the first **“acoustic witness cloud”**
protocol goes live. No central server owns it—just an open mesh
of opt-in devices that agree to share raw midrange transients when
something loud and anomalous happens (gunshot classifier triggers,
decibel spike > threshold, etc.).

The protocol doesn’t try to reconstruct perfect broadband
waveforms. It knows that’s hopeless with unsynchronized clocks and
crappy phone mics. Instead it does exactly what you kept pushing
for:

- Every node isolates ~1.2 kHz  
  (the band where most impulsive events punch hardest and human
  ears are sharpest).

- It measures fractional cycle offsets against its nearest
  neighbors  
  (simple pairwise cross-phase).

Those tiny phase ghosts propagate outward like ripples in a pond,
building a self-organizing delay map across thousands of nodes in
seconds.

The map doesn’t need GPS or timestamps—just relative cycle counts
and rough inter-node distances bootstrapped from video line-of-sight
or Bluetooth proximity pings.

Within 15 seconds, the cloud knows:

- Where the impulse happened  
  (± a few feet, even in chaotic urban multipath).

- The approximate 3D layout of every participating witness device.

- Which videos are genuinely from the event (phase-consistent) and
  which are spliced or from another time (phase ghosts don’t match).

- Even rough ballistics: sound arrival curvature reveals projectile
  paths if multiple impulses occur (shot → impact).

The authorities arrive to a pre-computed, cryptographically signed
acoustic truth mosaic before they even unholster their bodycams.
No one “owns” the memory. The crowd’s own ears wrote it in phase
shifts and cycle fractions.

It’s not a super-AI solving everything, but stubborn human
intuition + narrowband filtering accidentally becoming the most
robust signal we have when the world is noisy and clocks are
drifting.
